# KitchenKaleidoscope

KitchenKaleidoscope is a fully functional online recipe book application that allows users to store and organize their favorite recipes. The application allows users to create an account, login, create, view, update, and delete their own recipes. It also allows users to search for and view recipes created by other users. Other features include the ability to create and manage ingredients and units for everyone to use. Finally, the app is fully responsive and can be used both from a computer or a smartphone.

## Technologies Used

-   TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that allows for type checking at compile time.
-   Sass: A CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, functions, and nesting to CSS.
-   React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   Redux: A predictable state container for managing the state of the application.
-   ExpressJS: A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js.
-   Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
-   MongoDB: A NoSQL document database that stores data in JSON-like documents.
-   PostGreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database management system.
-   MaterialUI: A popular React UI library that provides a range of customizable components.
-   ViteJS: A build tool that provides fast and efficient development and production builds for modern web applications.

## API

The recipe sharing web application features a custom-made API created using ExpressJS. The API handles all data management in the application, including user authentication, recipe creation, and ingredient management. To further enhance my skills, I experimented with using two different databases - MongoDB for non-relational data hosted on Atlas, and PostGreSQL for relational data hosted on Render.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Recipe Sharing App, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` to start the Front end development server. To run the Back end one you should run `npm run start-dev`.

## Contributing

Contributions to the Recipe Sharing App are always welcome! If you'd like to contribute, simply fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. You can also send me a message to let me know anything you'd like to see being changed.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the creators of the various technologies used in this project, as well as the Render platform for hosting the app's API.
